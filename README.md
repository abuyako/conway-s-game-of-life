The game of life also know simply as LIfe, is a cellular automation devised by the British Mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.

The "game" is the zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interact with the game of life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves.
